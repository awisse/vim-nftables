# vim-nftables

## Installation

Recommend [NeoBundle](https://github.com/Shougo/neobundle.vim) for installation.

Add the following to your vimrc:

```vim
NeoBundle 'nfnty/vim-nftables'
```

NeoBundle is no longer actively maintained. In newer versions of vim, there is no need for a plugin manager:

```
mkdir $HOME/.vim/pack/vendor/start
cd $HOME/.vim/pack/vendor/start
git checkout https://github.com/awisse/vim-nftables.git
```

The plugin will now be loaded automatically on startup.
